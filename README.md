# misc
As the name suggests, this is a misc repo. The pieces of code I want to share with the world go here.

"MONOPOLY.cpp"
  The file has the code for a simple encoding problem. The question was as follows :
    In an encoding system, each letter is moved forward by 'x' positions 'x' times, given that 'x' is the position of the letter in the English Alphabet. Encode the given word (in the original question, it was "MONOPOLY", but the program takes user input) according to the given encode rule.
